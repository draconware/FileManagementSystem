# FileManagementSystem

In this app, we have provided functionality to insert a new file, search for an existing file and delete a file. The app starts with login page that asks you to signup if not registered.
After that you can login in your account and maintain your files. It works for an organization where everyone can see it's files current location (profile of fileholder and time he/she got the file).
After login it asks you to either add a new file or search for an existing file. If you want to add a new file, then you it displays a page where you fill all file identification details and click on the submit button provided.Like this you can successfully make an entry of your file.
If you choose to search for an existing file, then it asks for unique file id or fileholder name or filename, that is being assigned with every file. It searches for the file in the database and gives you all promising results. Select the one that fits your condition.
After that app provides functionality to either change the file location or delete the file from the database.
